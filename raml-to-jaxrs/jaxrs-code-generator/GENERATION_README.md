## Resource and Response generation control

We have an experimental feature to allow for controlling the generation process.

It's possible to modify class/interface/method generation through usage of RAML 1.0 annotations.
Current annotations are:
``` yaml
annotationTypes:
    types:
        allowedTargets: TypeDeclaration
        properties:
            className?:
                type: string
            implementationClassName?:
                type: string
            usePrimitiveType?:
                type: boolean
            abstract?:
                type: boolean
    resources:
        allowedTargets: [Resource, API]
        properties:
            onResourceClassCreation?: string
            onResourceClassFinish?: string
    methods:
        allowedTargets: [Method, API]
        properties:
            onResourceMethodCreation?: string
            onResourceMethodFinish?: string
            onResponseClassCreation?: string
            onResponseClassFinish?: string
    responses:
        allowedTargets: [Response, API]
        properties:
            onResponseMethodCreation?: string
            onResponseMethodFinish?: string
```

The *Creation methods are fairly early in the process and the *Finish methods are called just before the build
is done.  I'm not sure that the two phases are useful.  As we said, this is experimental (we might change the interface).

The classes that interfaces the allow for interception are [here](src/main/java/org/raml/jaxrs/generator/extension).

The classes/interfaces/methods will be generated by JavaPoet.  Each of the methods should return the *.Builder that was passed to it OR a new
one built by the method.  The idea here is that if a method returns null, the class will not be generated.
