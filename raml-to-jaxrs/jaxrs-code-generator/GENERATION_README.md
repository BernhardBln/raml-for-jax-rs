RAML for JAX-RS
===============

We have an experimental feature to allow for controlling the generation process.

It's possible to modify class/interface/method generation through usage of RAML 1.0 annotations.
Current annotations are:
``` yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
annotationTypes:
    resources:
        allowedTargets: Resource
        properties:
            onResourceClassCreation?: string
            onResourceClassFinish?: string
    methods:
        allowedTargets: Method
        properties:
            onMethodCreation?: string
            onMethodFinish?: string
            onResponseClassCreation?: string
            onResponseClassFinish?: string
    responses: 
        allowedTargets: Response
        properties:
            onResponseMethodCreation?: string
            onResponseMethodFinish?: string
```

The *Creation methods are fairly early in the process and the *Finish methods are called just before the build 
is done.  I'm not sure that the two phases are useful.  As we said, this is experimental (we might change the interface). 

The classes that interfaces the allow for interception are [here](src/main/java/org/raml/jaxrs/generator/extension).

The classes/interfaces/methods will be generated by JavaPoet.  Each of the methods should return the *.Builder that was passed to it OR a new 
one built by the method.
